# CFH Furnitualizer – AR Furniture Placement App

**Flutter + Unity + ARCore | Final Year Project (2022–2023)**  
CFH Furnitualizer is an augmented-reality–based furniture shopping application that allows users to **visualize 3D furniture in their actual room** using **ARCore**.  
Built with **Flutter**, **Unity 3D**, and **Firebase**, it provides an immersive, modern shopping experience for customers and a simple management interface for admins.

## Overview

Traditional online furniture shopping lacks visualization—customers often buy furniture that does not fit their space or interior.  
CFH Furnitualizer solves this by enabling users to:

- Browse furniture products  
- View detailed specifications  
- Preview furniture in 3D  
- Place furniture directly in their room using **Augmented Reality (ARCore)**  
- Manage cart, orders, and profile  
- Enjoy a clean, user-friendly UI  

The admin panel (via Firebase) allows the business owner to manage products, users, and orders.

This project was developed as a **Final Year BSCS Project** at the International Islamic University Islamabad.
